Hi - i'm making a drag and drop inspired game similar to https://drlingua.com/japanese/games/kana-bento/ for learning the Korean alphabet as an English speaker. 

to-do:

- add in 40 different svgs & finish filling out the map
use cases for drag & drop:
- is it a romanji character? only then remove it - 
- is it a parent character? error handling
- is it a match ? 


later on - sound features:
- if it isn't a match then make a noise
- if it is a match then make a noise
- how to bring music in 
-
