Hi - i'm making a drag and drop inspired game similar to https://drlingua.com/japanese/games/kana-bento/ for learning the Korean alphabet as an English speaker. 

Icons used in early testing from:
fontawesome.com


to-do:

Decide on mapping:
- which is best for space and time (does it make a difference here)

Svg actions:
- make 40 for hangul
- make 40 for romanji

Filtering:
- filtering for the different types
- on click - make icons unclickable or undraggable or grey them out

readiability:
- break filtering into it's own file

later on - sound features:
- if it isn't a match then make a noise
- if it is a match then make a noise
- how to bring music in
