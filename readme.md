Hi - i'm making a drag and drop inspired game similar to https://drlingua.com/japanese/games/kana-bento/ for learning the Korean alphabet as an English speaker. 

Pulled info from:
https://www.90daykorean.com/how-to-learn-the-korean-alphabet/
& duolingos grammar categories

Icons used in early testing from:
fontawesome.com


to-do:

readiability:
- try to break elements into their own files
- look into reset functionality

features:
- add in time clock
- after the first piece is moved then filtering needs to stop working = no more changes until reset or revert to menu
- make it so you can't drop into greyed out functionality
- change it so no matter what browser/size you view it from it shouldn't impact things
- on reset - filtering also needs to be reset 

bugs:
- figure out what is going on with the footer clicks

small things:
- remove the character from mapping - not being used
- change the clickable component in the blocks to be something else - like is active
- change the icons mapping to not be 3 deep for the reset 
- the body is weird and not sized properly to match the elements
- make it so the footer doesn't have to disappear on reset is possible
- change overall sizing so scroll isn't needed


background:
- home screen
- menu screen
