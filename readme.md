Hi - i'm making a drag and drop inspired game similar to https://drlingua.com/japanese/games/kana-bento/ for learning the Korean alphabet as an English speaker. 

Pulled info from:

& duolingos grammar categories

Icons used in early testing from:
fontawesome.com

Vanilla JS tech stack

Website currently deployed at: https://jbacheldor.github.io/dragAndDropHangul/

nice-to-haves:
- increase drop area - right now it's a little finnicky
- using text instead of pictures causes blocks to be higlighted as you move it. 
- when you finish the game - a little pop up with a congrats message would be nice
- when it gets to the one hour mark have a pop up that says "automatic restart" 



what i would have done differently:
- used a javascript game engine for the desktop app
- used flutter to create a phone app
